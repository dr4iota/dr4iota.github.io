Switch instantly between classic and modern fractals—like Mandelbrot, Julia, and Newton—and explore them in real time with fluid pan and zoom. As you navigate, the app overlays precise complex coordinates and live view ranges, helping you connect visual patterns to their underlying math.</p><h3>What you can explore</h3><ul><li><strong>Multiple fractal families</strong>: Start with Mandelbrot, Julia, and Newton (and more varieties as they’re added), each with distinct visual structure and mathematical character.</li><li><strong>Rich color schemes</strong>: Pick from curated color palettes to reveal detail, shading, and structure in new ways.</li><li><strong>Real-time interaction</strong>: Navigate smoothly; every movement updates a helpful overlay that includes current complex coordinates and view extents.</li></ul><h3>Intuitive controls that invite experimentation</h3><ul><li><strong>Parameter sliders</strong>: Tune fractal-specific parameters with responsive sliders designed for fine-grained control (including non-linear scaling where appropriate).</li><li><strong>Complex parameters via control points</strong>: For fractals defined by complex constants, drag control points directly on the canvas to shape the set dynamically. Double‑click a control point to reset it.</li><li><strong>Context-aware layout</strong>: On larger screens, controls sit to the left of the canvas; on phones in portrait mode, they adapt to the top—always within easy reach.</li></ul><h3>Helpful, math-aware guidance</h3><ul><li><strong>Inline math and documentation</strong>: Learn the theory behind each fractal with clear, readable math. Toggle a “Math” help modal tailored to the current fractal, or open a “Controls” guide for tips on interaction.</li><li><strong>Live info overlay</strong>: See exact complex coordinates under the cursor, plus real and imaginary ranges of the current view, alongside a concise status line for the active fractal.</li></ul><h3>A focused, polished UI</h3><ul><li><strong>Streamlined toolbar</strong>: The header features compact drop-downs for fractal type and color scheme—icon-only when space is tight, descriptive when there’s room.</li><li><strong>Dark mode support</strong>: Enjoy a thoughtfully styled dark theme for comfortable exploration day or night.</li><li><strong>Share with a link</strong>: It’s easy to share exactly what you’re viewing.</li></ul><h3>Built for performance and portability</h3><ul><li><strong>High-performance rendering</strong>: Real-time visualization ensures responsive exploration even at deep zoom levels.</li><li><strong>Fast and responsive</strong>: Quick to load with smooth interaction.</li><li><strong>Desktop and mobile</strong>: Ready for desktop and mobile builds, bringing the same experience beyond the browser.</li></ul><h3>Who it’s for</h3><ul><li><strong>Curious explorers</strong>: Anyone captivated by visual complexity and emergent patterns.</li><li><strong>Students and educators</strong>: A hands-on way to connect complex numbers, iterative systems, and geometry with compelling visuals.</li><li><strong>Math and art enthusiasts</strong>: A canvas for creative rendering and mathematical experimentation.</li></ul><p>Whether you’re zooming into a Mandelbrot filament, reshaping a Julia set via a complex control point, or studying Newton basins with precise parameter control, Fantastic Fractals makes the deep structure of mathematics both approachable and beautiful.</p></div></noscript></div></body></html>

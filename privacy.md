## Privacy Policy for Fantastic Fractals

Effective date: 2025-08-12

This Privacy Policy explains what information the Fantastic Fractals app ("Fantastic Fractals", "we", "us") processes when you use it, why we process it, and the choices you have. We design for privacy and collect only what is necessary to provide the experience described in the app’s documentation.

If you have questions or requests, contact: <dr2iota@gmail.com>.

## What this app does

Fantastic Fractals is an interactive fractal explorer (e.g., Mandelbrot, Julia, Newton) with real‑time pan/zoom, color palettes, overlays for complex coordinates and view extents, and share‑by‑link. In the future, we may add optional user accounts and multi‑user experiences (e.g., shared sessions or games). We will continue to follow a strict data‑minimization approach.

## Summary

- We do not sell your data, serve targeted ads, or share personal information with third parties for their own marketing.
- By default, we do not require you to create an account to use the app.
- We store most settings locally on your device (e.g., palettes, last view, control points). Share links encode view/parameters in the URL.
- Server logs may capture minimal technical data needed to operate the service (e.g., IP address, timestamps, error logs). We keep these for a limited time.
- If we introduce accounts or multiplayer, we will only collect data necessary for those features (see below) and will update this policy as needed.

## Information we process

### Information you provide

- App preferences and parameters: When you adjust controls (e.g., palette, parameters, control points), that information is stored locally in your browser and/or represented in URLs you choose to share. We do not receive this information unless a request to our servers is needed to operate the feature (e.g., cloud sync in the future).
- Optional feedback or support messages: If you contact us, we will receive the information you include.

### Information processed automatically

- Basic service logs: Our hosting and security systems may log standard metadata such as IP address, request headers, timestamps, error details, and basic performance metrics. This is used for operations (e.g., troubleshooting, abuse prevention) and kept for a limited retention period.
- Device/runtime capabilities: The app may read capabilities (e.g., WebGL features) locally to adapt rendering. This typically stays on-device; we do not send this to our servers unless strictly required for performance diagnostics.
- Cookies and local storage: We use these to remember your settings and improve usability. We do not use third‑party advertising cookies.

### Future features (accounts and multiplayer)

If we introduce accounts or multi‑user experiences, we will process only the minimum data required:

- Account identifiers: For example, an email address or an OAuth provider identifier, plus authentication tokens. We will not request profile details beyond what is necessary to authenticate and provide the service.
- Display name (optional): If shown to other users in multiplayer contexts.
- Session and game/fractal state: Parameters needed to synchronize a shared session (e.g., current view, control points, room/session IDs). This may be visible to other participants you explicitly join.
- Moderation/anti‑abuse signals: Minimal metadata strictly needed to keep the service safe (e.g., rate limiting data, rule violations where applicable).

We will update this policy and, where required, request consent before launching such features.

## How we use information

- Provide and improve the app, including rendering, performance, and reliability.
- Maintain security and prevent abuse.
- Offer requested features such as share‑by‑link; links may contain parameters that reveal your current view/choices to anyone with the link.
- Communicate with you about the app if you reach out to us.

## Legal bases (EEA/UK users)

Where applicable, we rely on the following legal bases:

- Performance of a contract: To provide the app and requested features.
- Legitimate interests: For security, fraud prevention, service quality, and basic analytics aligned with user expectations.
- Consent: Where required (e.g., optional analytics or new features). You can withdraw consent at any time.

## Analytics

Currently, we do not run invasive analytics. If we add privacy‑preserving analytics in the future, it will be limited to aggregate, non‑identifying metrics and/or self‑hosted solutions. Where required, we will request consent and provide opt‑out controls.

## Data sharing

We do not sell personal data. We may share information with:

- Service providers (e.g., hosting, error logging) under agreements that restrict their use of data to our instructions.
- Legal and safety: If required by law or to protect the rights, property, or safety of users or the public.

## Data retention

- Local preferences: Stored on your device until you clear them.
- Server logs/diagnostics: Retained only as long as necessary for operations and security, then deleted or anonymized.
- Account and multiplayer data (future): Retained for as long as your account or session is active and for a reasonable period thereafter for backup, security, or legal compliance.

## International transfers

If we transfer data across borders, we will use appropriate safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) where required by law.

## Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your information, and to object to or restrict certain processing. To exercise these rights, contact us using the details above. We will honor these requests as required by applicable law.

## Children’s privacy

Fantastic Fractals is not directed to children under 13 (or the age required by your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us to remove it.

## Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. No system is 100% secure; we encourage you to use current software and secure your devices.

## Changes to this policy

We may update this policy to reflect changes in the app or law. We will post the updated version here and revise the effective date. Material changes will be highlighted within the app where appropriate.
